Description: display or change ethernet card settings
 ethtool is used for querying settings of an ethernet device and changing them.
 .
 Many ethernet drivers in 2.4 or newer kernel can be queried and tuned using
 ethtool.
 .
 However, backward compatibility is ensured on 2.2 kernel running Sparc with
 SUN Happy Meal (hme) Ethernet card.
